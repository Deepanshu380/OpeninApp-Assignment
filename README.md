# CRUD Application README

This README provides an overview and instructions for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application implemented in Java. The application allows you to perform basic CRUD operations on a data source, such as a database or file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
- A database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) if you plan to use a database

## Getting Started

To get started with the CRUD application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Configuration

The application may require some configuration depending on the data source you choose. Follow the steps below to configure the application:

### Database Configuration

If you plan to use a database, follow these steps to configure the application:

1. Open the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.
2. Update the database connection properties such as URL, username, and password according to your database setup.

### File Configuration

If you plan to use a file-based data source, follow these steps to configure the application:

1. Open the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.
2. Update the file path property according to the location of your data file.
Once the application is running, you can perform the following CRUD operations:

- **Create**: Use a web browser or an API testing tool (e.g., Postman) to send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/api/resource` with the necessary data in the request body.
- **Read**: Use a web browser or an API testing tool to send a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/api/resource` to retrieve all resources or `http://localhost:8080/api/resource/{id}` to retrieve a specific resource by ID.
- **Update**: Use a web browser or an API testing tool to send a PUT request to `http://localhost:8080/api/resource/{id}` with the updated data in the request body.
- **Delete**: Use a web browser or an API testing tool to send a DELETE request to `http://localhost:8080/api/resource/{id}` to delete a specific resource by ID.

Replace `{id}` with the actual ID of the resource you want to retrieve, update, or delete.

## Conclusion

This README provides an overview and instructions for a CRUD application implemented in Java. By following the steps mentioned above, you should be able to configure, build, and run the application, as well as perform basic CRUD operations on the data source. Feel free to modify the application to suit your specific needs and requirements.
